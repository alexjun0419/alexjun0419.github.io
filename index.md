### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was a favorite because I am always using unit conversion to search on Google, especially kg to lb and mile to km. I am always wondering what is the process and algorithm to be conversed so fast by a program. I did confirm how the conversion is going through the code and it was pretty fast.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was a favorite because as my major is mathematics and statistics, it is exciting how the program will compute the arithmetic mean. The code of calculation was written as sum divided by n simple. When I input any numbers, it gives the average very fast.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 2, was a favorite lab because it gives statistical information about California. The program provides a county's name in California and the population of the County. It was interesting how many people live by County. I checked several counties, such as Orange County, Los Angeles, San Deigo, and San Francisco, major cities in California.
